The main goal of this library is to provide an API that simplifies the development of powerful software applications, such as OpenGL/Vulkan 3D games and engineering tools.

The focus of this library is on matrix analysis, but more abstract functionalities suitable for scientific computing are also implemented.

The reason C has been chosen for this library is performance and portability. Code is benchmarked and a CMake script to build the library on any platform that supports it is available.
